# Calebder View

This is a Flask application that displays server patch schedules in a calendar format. It allows users to view events in monthly, weekly, or daily views and provides an option to export the data to Excel.

Next, I should explain how to install the project. Since it's using Poetry for dependency management, I'll mention installing Poetry and then running `poetry install`.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```
